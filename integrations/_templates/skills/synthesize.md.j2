{#- Cross-source synthesis - combine multiple source analyses into a higher-level view -#}

Create a **cross-source synthesis** across multiple source analyses and existing claims.

Use this after running `{{ invocation_prefix }}check` on multiple sources (or when you already have relevant source analyses and want a higher-level conclusion).

{% include "partials/prerequisites.md.j2" %}

## When to Use

Run synthesis when the task is inherently **multi-source**:
- compare/contrast competing approaches
- reconcile conflicting claims
- summarize the overall state of evidence on a topic
- produce a decision-oriented “what should we believe?” output

## Output Contract

Write a synthesis document to:
`PROJECT_ROOT/analysis/syntheses/<synth-id>.md`

**Required elements**:
1. **Synthesis metadata** (topic, date, synthesis ID)
2. **Claims referenced** (claim IDs)
3. **Source analysis links** for relevant sources (prefer linking `analysis/sources/<source-id>.md`)
4. **Agreement/disagreement** with explanations
5. **Synthesis conclusions** with calibrated credence and key uncertainties

**Corner case**: If you have *claims/evidence but no analyzable sources*, explicitly say so and explain why (e.g., internal notes, private sources, offline materials). Still reference claim IDs and any evidence artifacts available.

## Workflow

1. **Define the question** - What is this synthesis trying to answer?
2. **Collect inputs**
   - Prefer existing source analyses in `analysis/sources/`
   - If a relevant source has no analysis yet, run `{{ invocation_prefix }}check` first (or document the gap)
3. **Build a cross-source map**
   - Points of agreement (which claims converge?)
   - Points of disagreement (where do they conflict, and why?)
4. **Write the synthesis**
   - Link each major claim back to source analyses (when available)
   - Resolve conflicts where possible; otherwise record open questions + what would resolve them
5. **(Optional) Register an argument chain**
   - Use `rc-db chain add ... --analysis-file "analysis/syntheses/<synth-id>.md" --claims "ID1,ID2,..."` for the central claim chain
6. **Update README**
   - Add the synthesis to the “Syntheses” table (kept **above** “Source Analyses”)
7. **Commit and push**
   - Commit changes to `analysis/` and `README.md` (and any generated exports), then push
